# instagram-clone

This project is dedicated to creating an instagram web-app clone with most comprehensive functionality as possible. The main tech stack includes React.js for frontend, Springboot for backend and mysql as database. In order to be as consistent as possible with the native UIs, most of the UI components are customized with plain css, except for a minimum usage of Material UI library.
